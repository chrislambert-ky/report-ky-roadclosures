# Project Outline: Interactive Road Closure Dashboard

### Introduction

---

* **Objective:** Develop a responsive web application that visualizes road closure data sourced from the Kentucky Department of Highways.
* **Tools and Technologies:** HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries), JavaScript, and Apache eCharts.
* **Goals:**
  - Implement a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for business intelligence.
  - Enable dynamic filtering and exploration of closure data by district and year.

### Responsive Design

---

**Implementation**
   * Employ CSS Grid and/or Flexbox for flexible, adaptive layouts.
   * Ensure all dashboard components (charts, dropdowns, maps) are responsive.

### Feature Implementation

**Core Features**
   * Store and manage road closure data using arrays, objects, or appropriate data structures.
   * Visualize data with interactive charts (e.g., closures per district, closures per year, top 10 counties, and a map view).
   * Integrate dropdown filters for district and year selection to update visualizations dynamically.

**Data Integration**
   * Use your existing Python project to fetch and preprocess road closure data.
   * Serve the processed data to the frontend via an API endpoint.

### Data Handling and Analysis

---

**Data Storage and Retrieval**
   * Store closure data in structured formats (JSON, arrays, or objects).
   * Implement efficient data retrieval and update mechanisms for filtering and visualization.

**Data Visualization**
   * Use Apache ECharts to create interactive visualizations:
     * Number of closures per district
     * Number of closures per year
     * Top 10 counties with closures
     * (Optional) Map visualization of closure locations

### Advanced Features (Optional)

---

**User Interaction**
   * Add forms or controls for custom filtering (e.g., by date range or county).

**Data Export/Sharing**
   * Allow users to export filtered data or charts as images or CSV files.

### Project Development

---

**Backend Integration**
   * Implement API to reprocess location information using KYTC Geo API.

**Frontend Development**
   * Build the dashboard interface using modern JavaScript and ECharts.
   * Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend.

### Review Process

---

**Internal Testing**
   * Test all dashboard features for accuracy, responsiveness, and usability.
   * Validate data filtering and visualization updates.

**External Feedback**
   * Gather feedback from users or stakeholders and iterate on the design and features.

### Documentation and Final Submission

---

**Code Documentation**
   * Comment code for clarity and maintainability.
   * Prepare a comprehensive README.md with:
     * Project overview and objectives
     * Setup and installation instructions
     * Usage guidelines and feature descriptions
     * Data source and API integration details

**Final Submission**
   * Ensure the dashboard is fully functional, well-documented, and ready for presentation or deployment.
